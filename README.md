# üé¨ GIC Cinema Booking Application

A command-line cinema booking application built with Python. This app allows users to search for available movies, book tickets, and manage reservations.

The system is designed using two main classes:

1. Cinema: Manages seating, seat availability, and basic utilities.
2. BookingService: Handles the business logic for auto/manual bookings and manages bookings per group.
3. CLI: The user interface of the application

# üé® DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS

- Seats are represented using a 2D list (`seats` or `seating`) where `'.'` means available, `'X'` or `'#'` means booked.
- Booking IDs are generated in the format `GIC0001`, `GIC0002`, etc.
- Auto-assignment starts from the top-left and prefers centering the group if possible.
- Manual booking expects a seat label like `A01`, `B02`, etc.
- The application is **console-based** and mainly meant to be run/tested using **unit tests**.
